    <h2>What is call of duty?</h2>
    <p>
      <em>Call of Duty</em> is a first-person shooter military video game series and media franchise 
      published by Activision, starting in 2003. The games were first developed by Infinity Ward, 
      then by Treyarch and Sledgehammer Games. Several spin-off and handheld games were made by other developers.

    </div>
    <p>
      First, choose one of the three options: Guest, Garena, or Facebook. 
      The Guest option is not recommended because once you delete Call of Duty: Mobile, your account will be lost as well. 
      You can choose either Garena or Facebook. Most people use Facebook, but you can also use Garena. 
      Just sign up at the Garena Account Center through Google, then open the CODM app again and log in.
    </p>

    <h2>Cellphone specs suggestions</h2>
    <p>
      For a smooth Call of Duty: Mobile experience, you need a phone with a 
      <strong>high-performance processor (like a modern Snapdragon or RedMagic chip), at least 6-8 GB of RAM, and a 90Hz or higher display</strong> for optimal frame rates and responsiveness. 
      A good cooling system is also essential for sustained performance during long gaming sessions.
